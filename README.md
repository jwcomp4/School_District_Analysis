# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

- This analysis examines the Math and Reading test scores as they relate to individual schools, school types, school sizes, overall school budgets, and spending per student.
- After performing the initial analysis, the school board discovered academic dishonesty among the Thomas High School 9th grade requiring a new analysis factoring in this new information. 
- Therefore, all Thomas High School 9th grade Math and Reading scores were replaced with NaN and the school district analysis has been repeated. 

## Results

- Replacing the Thomas High School 9th grade test scores with NaN requires recalculating student test score totals and average math and reading scores to complete the School District Analysis with accuracy and integrity. 

- Afer replacing these values, Thomas High School is still ranked the number 2 top school.
    - This is largely due to removing the number of 9th grade students when calculating the averages and passing percentages (Math, Reading, and Overall).
